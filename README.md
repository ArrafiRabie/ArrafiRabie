## Hi there 👋

## 👋 Hey there, I'm Rabie Arrafi

I'm not just a developer. I'm someone who found a deep connection with the machine,  
someone who speaks fluently in C++ and C#, not just through syntax — but through logic, creativity, and endless hours of problem-solving.

💻 I specialize in Data Structures and Algorithms using **C++** and **C#**,  
and I have solid experience in working with complex **SQL Server** databases.  
For me, solving problems isn't a task — it's a passion.  
I enjoy diving deep into code, optimizing solutions, and building robust systems.

⚒️ Over the years, I’ve built and contributed to many real-world projects —  
pushing myself to write better, cleaner, and more efficient code every single day.

☕ I’m the kind of developer who prefers silence, a warm cup of coffee,  
and the company of my computer — my truest friend in a noisy world.

### 🧠 What Defines Me:
- Deep expertise in **Data Structures** & **Algorithms**
- Strong command of **C++**, **C#**, and **SQL Server**
- Builder of real, solid systems — no fancy frontend, just reliable backend power
- Constant learner, quiet thinker, focused mind

If you're looking for fancy animations or colorful UI,  
I'm not your guy.

But if you're looking for someone who **solves**, who **thinks deeply**,  
and who codes with purpose — then welcome to my world.

📫 You can reach out if you speak the language of code...  
Otherwise, you'll find me here — in the quiet.
